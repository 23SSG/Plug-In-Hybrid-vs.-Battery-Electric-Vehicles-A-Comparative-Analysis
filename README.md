# Plug-In-Hybrid-vs.-Battery-Electric-Vehicles-A-Comparative-Analysis

📘 Project Overview
 As the shift toward sustainable transportation accelerates, electric vehicles (EVs) have become a key solution for reducing carbon emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. This analysis compares two major EV types—Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) and Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)—focusing on efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and popularity. By incorporating real-world data and examining the latest EV models from leading manufacturers such as Tesla, Ford, Toyota, and BMW, this study explores how advancements in battery technology range and charging infrastructure influence consumer choices. The goal is to determine which vehicle type offers the best balance of sustainability, convenience, and economic viability in today’s evolving automotive landscape.

## 📂 Data Instructions

The original datasets are not located in subfolders. 
To run the notebook successfully:

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Place the following CSV files in the **same directory** as the notebook:
   - Electric Vehicle Population Data.csv 
3. Open the notebook `Electric Vehicle-2.ipynb ` and run all cells.

> Note: The notebook uses relative paths assuming the CSV files are in the same folder.


## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project also highlighted my **data cleaning and exploratory data analysis skills**. Key steps included:

* **Handling Missing Values:** Identified and addressed missing entries to ensure model-ready datasets.
* **Removing Duplicates:** Ensured each row represented a unique vehicle entry for accurate analysis.
* **Categorical vs. Numerical Columns:** Distinguished column types to apply appropriate analyses and visualizations.
* **Correlation Analysis:** Generated a **correlation matrix** to identify relationships between features.
* **Visualizations:** Created **heatmaps** to visualize feature correlations, helping interpret data trends and potential predictors.

Through these steps, the dataset was prepared for meaningful comparative analysis between **Plug-In Hybrid (PHEVs)** and **Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)**, ensuring robust insights and reliable conclusions.
