## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project also highlighted my **data cleaning and exploratory data analysis skills**. Key steps included:

* **Handling Missing Values:** Identified and addressed missing entries to ensure model-ready datasets.
* **Removing Duplicates:** Ensured each row represented a unique vehicle entry for accurate analysis.
* **Categorical vs. Numerical Columns:** Distinguished column types to apply appropriate analyses and visualizations.
* **Correlation Analysis:** Generated a **correlation matrix** to identify relationships between features.
* **Visualizations:** Created **heatmaps** to visualize feature correlations, helping interpret data trends and potential predictors.

Through these steps, the dataset was prepared for meaningful comparative analysis between **Plug-In Hybrid (PHEVs)** and **Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)**, ensuring robust insights and reliable conclusions.
